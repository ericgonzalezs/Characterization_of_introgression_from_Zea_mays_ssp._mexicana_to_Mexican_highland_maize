Here is described how I made the linkage map for inv4m

1.- Filter de CML panel [here](https://github.com/sawers-rellan-labs/PTxREV_F2/blob/master/inv4m_linkagemap/Scripts_and_steps/CML_filtering)

2.- Filtering the PTs-1261 SNPs with the GBS CML sites and viceversa [here](https://github.com/sawers-rellan-labs/PTxREV_F2/blob/master/inv4m_linkagemap/Scripts_and_steps/Filtering_vcf_files)

3.- Create hapmap format [here](https://github.com/sawers-rellan-labs/PTxREV_F2/blob/master/inv4m_linkagemap/Scripts_and_steps/Hapmap_format)

4.- Tassel merging and filtering [here](https://github.com/sawers-rellan-labs/PTxREV_F2/blob/master/inv4m_linkagemap/Scripts_and_steps/Tassel_merging_and%20_filtering_of_filtered_hapmap_files)

5.- SNP images selection [here](https://github.com/sawers-rellan-labs/PTxREV_F2/blob/master/inv4m_linkagemap/Scripts_and_steps/PTs_1261_CML457.png) and with more SNPs with a more relax selection [here](https://github.com/sawers-rellan-labs/PTxREV_F2/blob/master/inv4m_linkagemap/Scripts_and_steps/inv4m_SNPs_m%C3%A1s.png)

6.- Priority SNP list [here](https://github.com/sawers-rellan-labs/PTxREV_F2/blob/master/inv4m_linkagemap/Scripts_and_steps/Priority_SNP_list.md)

7.- Other possible candidates [here](https://github.com/sawers-rellan-labs/PTxREV_F2/blob/master/inv4m_linkagemap/Scripts_and_steps/Other_SNP_candidates.md)
