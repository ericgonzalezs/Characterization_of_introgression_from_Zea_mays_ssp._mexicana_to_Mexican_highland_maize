PRE-PROCESSING OF DATA

GATK best practices were followed for the preprocessing of the WGS. The description of the pipelien can be found [here](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/bp_3step.php?case=GermShortWGS&p=1). 

The scripts of the preprocessing pipeline are [here](https://github.com/sawers-rellan-labs/PTxREV_F2/blob/master/Plant_material-DNA-extraction-sequencing_information_and_preprocessing_of_data/scripts/preprocessing)
