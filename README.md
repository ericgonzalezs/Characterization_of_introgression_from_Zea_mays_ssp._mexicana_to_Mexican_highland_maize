# PTxREV_F2

Here there is information about the steps to carry out the funtional analyses of introgression and low recombination regions in PT.

1. Plant material, DNA extraction, sequencing information and preprocessing of data [here](https://github.com/sawers-rellan-labs/PTxREV_F2/tree/master/Plant_material-DNA-extraction-sequencing_information_and_preprocessing_of_data)
