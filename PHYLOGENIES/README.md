The file used for the phylogenies was 1261_PTs_Low_mex_par_MQ30_BQ20_SNPs_filtered_GQ20_DP4_PASS_WH.vcf 
was obtained with GATK and was filtered with using the hard filters and then selecting only the sites that PASS those filters, 
then was filtered again for SNPs with a BQ above 20 and read depth above 4.
